          You are in luck, a caucus is not in a deep dark closet! So, no need to try to dig around through your old junk to find it. The location of your caucus is determined by where you live. Your city, town or neighborhood will be divided into small geographical areas called precincts. Each precinct will hold their own caucus, and they will notify community members with signs, flyers or possibly emails about when and where the caucus will be held.

        Hmm, that must have been the antique you inherited from your Grandma because you can’t donate a caucus. But, since you are feeling generous, you can donate your time by attending the caucus, making your voice heard, and perhaps even being willing to serve in a precinct or delegate role. Ready to help? Good! The location of your caucus is determined by where you live. Your city, town or neighborhood will be divided into small geographical areas called precincts.

       It may be time to care where to find your caucus because if you don’t go, your voice won’t be heard. If you like how things are then you should go to make sure things don’t change.  If you don’t like how things are then you should go to make some changes.  Either way, you should go. So, you should know, the location of your caucus is determined by where you live. Your city, town or neighborhood will be divided into small geographical areas called precincts. Each precinct will hold their own caucus, and they will notify community members with signs, flyers or possibly emails about when and where the caucus will be held.

          Kind of sounds like “I’ll have to check my calendar and get back to you,” but actually, that’s right, you’ll need to know your precinct because the location of your caucus is determined by where you live. Your city, town or neighborhood will be divided into small geographical areas called precincts. Each precinct will hold their own caucus, and they will notify community members with signs, flyers or possibly emails about when and where the caucus will be held.
