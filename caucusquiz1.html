          Correct! A caucus is a neighborhood meeting sponsored by a political party where community members come together to discuss political issues that concern them and their community. They elect precinct officers who help to organize the precinct, count votes, and run the caucus. They also elect delegates from within their neighborhood to represent them and their interests at political conventions on the local and state level.

        Hardly! There certainly is registering and counting, but the counting is of votes from all the people that have sense enough to attend. Actually, a caucus is a neighborhood meeting sponsored by a political party where community members come together to discuss political issues that concern them and their community. They elect precinct officers who help to organize the precinct, count votes, and run the caucus. They also elect delegates from within their neighborhood to represent them and their interests at political conventions on the local and state level.

       Nice try! Although the caucus isnâ€™t a disease, the feeling of knowing you are really making a difference in the world can certainly be contagious. And the first sign of symptoms is taking a quiz about caucuses! So, you should know, a caucus is a neighborhood meeting sponsored by a political party where community members come together to discuss political issues that concern them and their community. They elect precinct officers who help to organize the precinct, count votes, and run the caucus. They also elect delegates from within their neighborhood to represent them and their interests at political conventions on the local and state level.

       Well, you are on the right track, perhaps. While there certainly is great information you can gain from attending a caucus, and it is a great start to a political endeavor, there is more to a caucus. Simply put, a caucus is a neighborhood meeting sponsored by a political party where community members come together to discuss political issues that concern them and their community. They elect precinct officers who help to organize the precinct, count votes, and run the caucus. They also elect delegates from within their neighborhood to represent them and their interests at political conventions on the local and state level.
