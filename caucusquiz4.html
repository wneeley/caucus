         Well, that’s a great community disaster plan, which is another way that neighborhoods can work together. Wouldn’t it be a disaster if we didn’t work together? Another disaster would be showing up to your caucus unprepared. So, when preparing for a caucus you should plan to be early to register. Bring your ID to prove your voting age, afterall, you look so young! (But, actually, few people know that you can vote or run for office in a caucus as long as you will be 18 by the general election date in November. Now that’s pretty cool!) Also, bring your voter registration or be prepared to register with the political party that night. Some political parties require you to be registered with them in order to vote.
         <br> Just as importantly, you can be prepared by studying the upcoming elections, candidates, and issues that concern you and your neighbors so that you can vote informed.

        Well, the cushion and tylenol are optional, but bring your phone as some precincts are trying to use technology to speed up the voting process. In addition, you should plan to be early to register. Bring your ID to prove your voting age, afterall, you look so young!

       No!!! Believe me, down the road you may regret it. Think of all those old people that just sit around and talk about the good old days -- yeah, those are probably the ones that didn’t go to their caucus! If you like things how they are then go to make sure they don’t change. So, you want to go? Good! You should plan to be early to register.
